              <p>Expand all tabs and then use CTRL + F to find all instances of the word or phrase you want to search for.</p>
              <h5>Important job specs:</h5>
              <p>These must be read for every job. Customers can change these requirements from job-to-job, so they must be read for each job. If you only want to review the job specs marked as important, you can click the 'only show important' button to only show a list of important instructions.</p>
              <h5>Job spec sections:</h5>
              <p>These sections group the job specs into logical blocks. For example, if you see something on-screen, then you will likely need to look at the Visual section. If you hear something, you will likely need to look at the Audio section.</p>
              <h5>Key:</h5>
              <p>The key informs you what the different colours mean. For example, green instructions are style guides that inform you how to type something.</p>
              <h5>Something not here?</h5>
              <p>The Job Specs communicate the requirements of the customer for this particular job. If you need to find out how the software works, it will likely be in the software's manual. If you have a question related to working for Vitac in general, then it is probably in the general working practices document.</p>

                          <p>Footage from previous episodes of the same programme is considered as archive. This is because it was footage recorded for a previous show and is therefore considered as borrowing from an archive collection.</p>

                          <p>Archive footage is taken from material obtained from a film library or archive and inserted into a documentary to show historical events or to add detail without the need for additional filming.

The colours may be different (it may even be black and white), the sound may not be as clear, and there may even be pixelation or fuzziness.</p>

                          <p>Reconstruction provides a dramatisation of real life events. It only needs to be logged when the reconstruction is found on a media file with 'real life' footage (usually interviews with the persons involved). If the entirety of the media consists of dramatisations of real life events (e.g. a film like the King's Speech) then there is no need to log reconstruction as it is assumed.</p>
                          <p>Reconstruction consists of artificial scenes of an event which have been reconstructed and acted out on film based on information of the event. Reconstructions generally provide factual information, and give the viewer a sense of realism, as if the event really happened in front of them live. They often indicate that the footage is not real by using techniques such as blurring, distortion, lighting effects, changes in camera level, and colour enhancement within the footage.</p>

For example, if the speaker pauses and then the scene changes to show what is going on in the speaker's thoughts - perhaps there is a hamster running in an exercise wheel to show not a lot is going on in the speaker's thoughts - and then the footage returns to the speaker to finish their dialogue, then continuing the dialogue after the pause in a new content block would make more sense.</p>

                          <p>If a speaker pauses at the <strong>end</strong> of a sentence before starting another sentence, then again, consider how you should represent the pause. Again, an ellipsis might be appropriate, but if the pause is <strong>very</strong> long, perhaps consider continuing the dialogue with a new timecode stamp and a fresh character label.</p>

                        <td><p>Singing in a live actuality situation is transcribed. Check your suggested markers to see if it should be proceeded by a relevant marker like Singing. Here are some examples of live singing that are transcribed: </p><ul><li>A documentary that follows somebody about in a reality type situation, anything that is sung by a speaker is transcribed.</li><li>In a documentary on Kylie Minogue, any live singing or karaoke in her local pub (or something similar) is transcribed as if it were dialogue.</li><li>In a kids show, if the main character bursts into song about the alphabet, it is transcribed.</li><li>In a drama where someone starts singing a lullaby to their child, this is transcribed.</li><li>In a musical like Mamma Mia, lyrics to the songs that are sung by characters in the show are transcribed.</li><li>For a scripted programme like a drama, lyrics coming from a song playing on the radio, tv or other device within the scene are included. However, if you are watching a reality show, you only need to include these lyrics if they are obviously intended to be heard by the viewer or are pertinent to the plot, e.g. someone is listening to their song being played on the radio for the first time.</li></ul><p>Lyrics of longer songs should be transcribed in verse form. However, if someone only sings a single word, or just a couple of words from a song, then you can keep this all on one line within their dialogue.</p><p/><h3>What is verse form?</h3>Verse form is the structure that songs are written in. They are made up of stanzas and verses. For example, if you were transcribing Shania Twain's "That Don't Impress Me Much", it would look something like this:<p><em>I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart<br/>But you've got being right down to an art<br/>You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall<br/>You're a regular original, a know-it-all<br/><br/>Oh, oh, you think you're special<br/>Oh, oh, you think you're something else</em></p><p>If you have no source material, try to match the song's meter, starting a new line where appropriate, especially if there is a rhyming scheme. Make sure that you start a new paragraph between two verses, or a verse and a chorus.</p><p>When writing in verse form, never end a line with a full stop, even if it is the last line in the song.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you have been provided a source script and the lyrics have been transcribed in verse form, copy this structure.</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Often when you Google search lyrics, you will be shown them in verse form.</p></td>

                          <p>ADR is used as a placeholder for the absent dialogue. This is often because they intend to re-record a line with the actor, or have not yet received the dialogue performance, and therefore have been unable to include it in the media file they have sent to Vitac.</p>
                          <p>You will only encounter ADR in versions of the media that are not the very final edit. Instead, ADR will occur in a 'rough cut' or an 'early version'. This means that the show has been edited to 95%, but there are still a few changes that will be made by the editor before they broadcast the show.</p>
                          <p>ADR often indicates who will be speaking, and what they said. Some editors will also indicate that the text is an ADR by prefixing it with 'ADR:'.</p>
                          <p>ADR should not be confused with subtitles. Subtitles are intended to be read by the viewer. ADR text on the other hand will be removed in the final edit of the show, and replaced with audio recordings of the actual dialogue.</p>
                          <p>Sometimes ADR is not added as on-screen text, but instead added by the editor recording their own voice - when this happens, log it as dialogue with your best guess at who you believe should actually be speaking in the speaker name.</p>

                          <p>Captions - used to supply the viewer with extra information to further their viewing pleasure - are usually a simple text event that could display a name, a place name, time, date, the text Coming up or Next week on Horizon etc. Captions can also be larger bodies of text, such as lists, personal profiles/bio and legal disclaimers etc. </p>
                          <p>Whilst captions tend not to change or evolve, they may be animated to fade in, swipe from the side of the screen, or appear line by line etc. As long as the text is readable in real-time by the viewer, it is likely going to be a caption.</p>
                          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Not all text on screen should be labelled as a caption. Ensure that you are aware of the other visual event types before selecting caption. For example:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Changing text, like money counters, or countdown timers, are not captions, they are Graphics on Screen.</li>
                            <li>Text that provides translation of the dialogue is not a caption, it is a Language Subtitle.</li>
                            <li>Text that repeats the dialogue in the same language is a Subtitle.</li>
                            <li>The name of the episode or the series being transcribed is the Title.</li>

It may mean that the person on the left hand side of the screen is captioned, and on the right hand side of the screen the other person is captioned. When this happens, captions are not formatted according to what is on screen. Instead double captions are logged as follows: The caption on the left hand side of the screen is copy typed first, then below it, the caption on the right hand side of the screen is copy typed. If the two captions appear at the same time, they are logged as one caption event. If there's a second or so interval between the captions, they are logged individually with their own timecode.</p>

The main title is the name of the production. Note that in TV, each season might have its own name - these are <strong>not</strong> episode titles. Instead, <strong>episode titles are individual names for each episode</strong>.</p><p> For example: a David Attenborough documentary called Planet Earth ran for two seasons. The first season's main title was Planet Earth, and the second season's main title was Planet Earth II. Each episode had its own individual title, such as Islands, Mountains, Jungles, etc. These individual titles are Episode Titles and should be logged each time they appear onscreen.</p><p/><h1>Examples</h1><ul><li>Friends: The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break</li><li>The Simpsons: Treehouse of Horror IV</li><li>Only Fools and Horses: Heroes and Villains</li></ul><p/><h1>Tips</h1><strong>TIP:</strong> Episode Titles are often found near the opening credits, as part of the title sequence, or at the very start of the show.<p><strong>TIP:</strong> Note that some TV shows might have more than one episode per transcript and thus have two different Episode Titles per script. This is common in kids TV programmes where the stories are shorter to keep their viewer's attention. Both Episode Titles should be logged.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> An Episode Title may appear alongside the Main Title. When this happens, the Episode Title is logged separately to the Main Title with their own Visual Events.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Episode titles are mentioned in the clock screen before the start of the programme. This should not be logged as an episode title, but instead just included as part of the clock screen visual event.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Not to be confused with the name of the entire series. The episode title is a sub heading for a specific episode from a wider series. </p></td>

                          <p>A graphic text event is usually made up of multiple graphical text entries, and is usually more complex than a simple caption. Here is a checklist that will help decide if the text on screen is Graphic Text:</p>

                            <li>Does the visual event have text?</li>

                          <p>If the answer to both is 'yes', then it is probably Graphic Text.</p>
                          <p>Here are a few examples of Graphic Text:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>A countdown timer is Graphic Text. The numbers counting down indicate a change of time. This text is 'developing'.</li>
                            <li>A bidding counter at an auction is Graphic Text. The money counting up indicates a change in the bidding amount. This text is 'developing'.</li>
                            <li>A map <em>might</em> contain Graphic Text, but it depends on how the text <strong>develops</strong>:<ul>	<li>If there are only a few locations labelled on the map, then it can probably be typed out in full as a <strong>Caption</strong>.</li><li>If the map develops to move from one location to another, or there are lots of location names popping up on the map, then the text on the map probably needs to be described in a Graphic Text visual event. This is because the text is 'developing' and needs more than just the locations to be copy typed.</li></ul></li>
                            <li>A scientific diagram <em>might</em> be Graphic Text, but it depends on how the text <strong>develops</strong>:<ul><li>If there is a very complicated diagram of a space station, but just a single piece of text indicating that this is a 'space station', then this is a <strong>Caption</strong>.</li><li>If this very same diagram contains lots of text explaining all the sections of the space station, and it is appearing so quickly that it is hard to keep up, then it probably needs to be logged as <strong>Graphic Text</strong>. Again, this text is 'developing'.</li>	</ul></li>

                          <p>Every show has a title sequence. Whether it is a few seconds or a minute long, the title sequence is a series of graphics or clips that lead up to the title of the show. You are probably familiar with a few famous title sequences, such as the openings to Eastenders, Coronation Street, BBC News, Match of the Day and Who Wants to be a Millionaire? All of which have a famous soundtrack and series of shots that lead up to the title of the show. Many shows use this opportunity to introduce cast members or locations that appear in the programme.</p>
                          <p>Not all title sequences will contain clips. They may just have a few graphics with the title of the show appearing.</p>

                            <li> The title sequence will always occur before the first ad break.</li>
                            <li>The title sequence will be the same for every episode. This means that recap and teaser sections are not considered part of the title sequence.</li>
                            <li>Unless you have been instructed otherwise, the dialogue during a title sequence should be transcribed.</li>
                            <li>If you have been asked to transcribe opening credits, you should include opening credits that occur during title sequences by logging them in their own visual event(s).</li>
                            <li>If you have been asked to transcribe captions, you should <strong>ignore</strong> captions that occur during the title sequence unless instructed otherwise.</li>

                          <p>Apostrophes are used to show that something belongs to someone or something else. For example:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Alice's coat (the coat belonging to Alice)</li>
                            <li>Jack's friend (the friend belonging to Jack)</li>
                            <li>The BBC's website (The website that belongs to the BBC)</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Add an apostrophe and an s ('s) to singular nouns and plural nouns that don't end in s, such as children and people. For example:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>the dog's dinner</li>
                            <li>the children's play area</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Just add an apostrophe to plural nouns that already end in s. For example:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>ladies' room</li>
                            <li>parents' evening</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p><em>Never</em> use an apostrophe to indicate a plural. This also applies to initials, abbreviations and numbers. For example:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>DVDs</li>
                            <li>1990s</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>An apostrophe is used in contractions to indicate that something is missing. For example:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>That DVD is rubbish becomes That DVD's rubbish</li>
                            <li>Cannot becomes can't</li>
                            <li>because becomes 'cause</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>It's should only be written to shorten it is or it has. When it's is being used as a pronoun (like his or her) it never takes an apostrophe.</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Correct:</strong> Never judge a book by its cover.</li>

For example, searching for Steve McQueen will likely show results for the actor who starred in The Great Escape. However, adding '12 Years a Slave' to the search will show results for a recent director with the same name.</td>

                          <p>Support material is provided to us by the client, it is not created by Vitac.</p>
                          <p>Support material can come in many forms, such as a credits list, contributor list, or a glossary of terms. However, the most common type of support material provided for post-edit jobs is the source script.</p>
                          <p>Source scripts are commonly available for scripted shows, but are rarely available for reality / documentary shows. If a source script has been provided, this is particularly useful for finding key names, phrases, and hard-to-hear dialogue. Try to follow the source script whilst typing the script, and unless you are instructed otherwise, you must follow the speaker name format. E.g. If Joe Bloggs has the speaker label "Bloggs" in the source script, you must use this speaker name in your own script.</p>
                          <p>If support material has been provided, the client expects it to be visible and referred to whilst typing the script.</p>
